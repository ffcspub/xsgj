##Introduction
RATreeView is a class designed to support implementation of the Tree View on IOS. It works as a wrapper for the UITableView, defining its own delegate and data source methods for easier managment for tree data structures.

As RATreeView is a wrapper for UITableView, most of delegate and data dource methods are just equivalents of specific methods from UITableView delegate and data source protocols. They are changed in the way they provide easier managment for the tree structures. There are also some new methods in protocols to provide support for expanding and collapsing rows of the tree view. It should work on IOS 5.0+.

##ARC Compatibility
RATreeView is implemented using ARC.

##Installation
To use RATreeView in your app, just drag RATreeView class files into your project and add *Quartz* framework to your project (*Quartz* is required since version 0.1.0). You can also setup RATreeView in your project using Pods. Nextly, import RATreeView.h header file and use it!

####Podfile
     pod "RATreeView", "~> 0.2.2" 


##Usage

    RATreeView *treeView = [[RATreeView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
    treeView.delegate = self;
    treeView.dataSource = self;
    
    [self.view addSubview:treeView];
    [treeView reloadData];


##RATreeNodeInfo
Almost every methods of the RATreeViewDelegate's and RATreeViewDataSource's protocol have the argument of the class RATreeNodeInfo. RATreeNodeInfo is logically connected with *item*. The purpose of this parameter is to support programmer with as much information as possible.

To make this possible RATreeNodeinfo has the following properties:
  
    @property (nonatomic, getter = isExpanded, readonly) BOOL expanded;

Returns YES if the item's row is expanded.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger treeDepthLevel;
Returns level of the item in the tree. The value for to root item children is 0.

    @property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) RATreeNode *parent;
Returns object's parent.

    @property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) NSArray *children;
Returns object's children.

    @property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) id item; 
Returns the item associated with an object.

##RATreeView
RATreeView has almost all properties which can be found in UITableView or UIScrollView.
#####It also implemements some new properties:
     @property (nonatomic) RATreeViewRowAnimation rowsExpandingAnimation;
Animation used for rows expanding. The default is RATreeViewRowAnimationTop.


     @property (nonatomic) RATreeViewRowAnimation rowsCollapsingAnimation;
Animation used for rows collapsing. The default is RATreeViewRowAnimationBottom.

#####New (comparing to UITableView) methods of the RATreeView:
     -(void)expandRowForItem:(id)item withRowAnimation:(RATreeViewRowAnimation)rowAnimation;

Expands row which is associated with given item. Item's row must be visible - his parent must be expanded. For no visible items that method do nothing.
	 
	 -(void)expandRowForItem:(id)item;
Expands row which is associated with given item. Item's row must be visible - his parent must be expanded. For no visible items that method do nothing. Uses animation type specified in *rowsExpandingAnimation* property.

     - (void)collapseRowForItem:(id)item withRowAnimation:(RATreeViewAnimation)rowAnimation;
Collapses row which is associated with given item. All children of the specified item will be collapsed.

     - (void)collapseRowForItem:(id)item;
Collapses row which is associated with given item. All children of the specified item will be collapsed. Uses animation type specified in **
*rowsCollapsingAnimation* property.

	 - (void)reloadRows
Reload all rows of the RATreeView without collapsing expanded ones. 

##RATreeView Data Source
#####RATreeViewDataSource contains following **required** methods:

    (NSInteger)treeView:(RATreeView*)treeView numberOfChildrenOfItem:(id)item;
    
This method should return the number of the child items encompassed by a given item. If *item* is nil, this method should return the number of children for the top-level item.

    (UITableViewCell *)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView cellForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo
    
This method ask the data source for a cell to insert for a particular *item*.

    (id)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView child:(NSInteger)index ofItem:(id)item;
    
This returns the child item at the specified index of a given item. If *item* is nil, returns the appropriate child item of the root object.

#####RATreeViewDataSource contains following **optional** methods:

    - (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;
    
This method ask the data source to commit the insertion or deletion of a specified row.
    
    
    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView canEditRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;
    
This method ask the data source to verify that the given row is editable. If not implemented all rows are assumed to be editable.  

##RATreeView Delegate
All methods of RATreeViewDelegate are **optional**. **RATreeViewDelegate contains almost all methods which all available in UITableViewDelegate**. For easier managment of the tree view names and arguments of this methods are slightly changed.

For example: 
    
    - (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;                                    // UITableViewDelegate
    - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willBeginEditingRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;								        // UITableViewDelegate


is changed to:

     - (CGFloat)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView heightForRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;               // RATreeViewDelegate
     - (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView willBeginEditingRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;  //RATreeViewDelegate

     
###RATreeViewDelegate contains following methods:
####Expanding and Collapsing

    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView shouldExpandRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;

This method ask the delegate whether row for the provided *item* should be expanded due to the user interaction (selection by the user). Called for collapsed rows with at least one child. By default row would be expanded. 

    - (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView willExpandRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;
    
This method informs delegate that specific row will be expanded due to the user interaction (selection by the user).

	- (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView didExpandRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo

This method informs delegate that specific row was expanded due to the user interaction (selection by the user).

    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView shouldCollapaseRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;

This methods ask the delegate whether row for the provided *item* should be collapsed due to the user interaction. Called for expanded rows with at least one child. By default row would be collapsed.

    - (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView willCollapseRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;
  
This method informs delegate that specific row will be collapsed due to the user interaction.

	- (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView didCollapseRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;

##Types
For the better encapsulation RATreeView declares some own enums which are equivalents for the enums declared for UITableView and UITableViewCell. These enums are used as properties types and in RATreeView's method calls. 

Equivalent for the UITableViewStyle:

    typedef enum {
      RATreeViewStylePlain = 0,
      RATreeViewStyleGrouped
    } RATreeViewStyle;

Equivalent for the UITableViewCellSeparatorStyle:

    typedef enum RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyle {
      RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyleNone = 0,
      RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyleSingleLine,
      RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyleSingleLineEtched
    } RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyle;


Equivalent for the UITableViewScrollPosition:

    typedef enum RATreeViewScrollPosition {
      RATreeViewScrollPositionNone = 0,
      RATreeViewScrollPositionTop,
      RATreeViewScrollPositionMiddle,
      RATreeViewScrollPositionBottom
    } RATreeViewScrollPosition;

Equivalent for the UITableViewRowAnimation:

    typedef enum RATreeViewRowAnimation {
      RATreeViewRowAnimationNone = 0,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationRight,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationLeft,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationTop,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationBottom,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationMiddle,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationAutomatic
    } RATreeViewRowAnimation;
